## Workflow: Plan → Research → Build → Audit → Run → Assess → Codify

Every cycle should make the next cycle better.

- **Plan:** Talk with the user. Understand the goal before touching code.
- **Research:** Send agents to verify claims and check novelty. Never assert facts without evidence.
- **Build:** Write code. Keep it clean. Comment the non-obvious.
- **Audit:** Send a separate agent to review code before running. Check shapes, gradients, stability. The implementer does not review their own work.
- **Run:** Use the hardware. Parallel experiments when possible.
- **Assess:** Be honest. Negative results are data. Don't spin.
- **Codify:** Update `STATE.md` and `EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`. If you learned a lesson, emit a `[LEARN]` block so it auto-saves to the learnings DB.

## Learnings DB

A SQLite DB at `.claude/memory/workflow.db` persists durable rules, corrections, and gotchas across sessions. Relevant rules auto-inject at prompt time via the `load-relevant-rules.sh` hook.

**When you learn something worth persisting, emit a `[LEARN]` block in your response:**

```
[LEARN] <category>: <one-line rule>
Mistake: <what went wrong>
Correction: <what the right approach is>
```

When you definitively kill a research direction, emit a `[DEAD-END]` block:

```
[DEAD-END] <direction>: <reason>
Evidence: <path to run dir or paper>
```

The brainstorm agent auto-loads relevant dead-ends on future "what should we try" prompts.

## Pre-Experiment Checklist (MANDATORY before every experiment)

1. **State the hypothesis in one sentence.** If you can't, don't run it.
2. **Predict the metric delta.** Record `predicted_delta` with `calibration.py add` — forces you to have a quantitative prior, and lets the harness track your calibration over time.
3. **Compute FLOPs, memory, and param count on paper.** 10 minutes. No exceptions.
4. **Try to disprove it in 5 minutes.** "Could a simpler baseline do this?"
5. **Check the literature first.** Send a research agent BEFORE building.
6. **Design the comparison before the experiment.** What's the baseline? Are params matched?
7. **Define success criteria.** What metric improvement justifies the compute cost?
8. **Verify the claim is novel.** Don't claim uniqueness without checking.

After the run, `calibration.py close <run_id> <hypothesis> <actual_delta>` closes the loop. Periodically `calibration.py report` to see if your priors are improving.

## Waterfall for new ideas

1. **Brainstorm agent** — Generate ideas.
2. **Research agent** — Validate against literature.
3. **Attack agent** — Find fatal flaws.
4. **Validation agent** — Confirm or deny each attack with evidence.

Only build what survives all four stages.

## Hard Rules (ML-research-specific; seed with `examples/seed_example_ml_research.py`)

- Verify before claiming. Use web search or research agents.
- Audit code with a separate agent before running.
- Smoke test every model (forward, backward, gradient check) before training.
- Use standard benchmarks for publishable claims.
- Save the exact script alongside experiment results for reproducibility.
- Log everything to a file. Produce a human-readable summary at the end.
- Smoke test must include EVAL batch size, not just training — eval can OOM even if training fits.
- Use the same dataset for ALL experiments in a comparison.
- DDP eval on rank 0 only will NCCL-timeout if eval >10 min. Set timeout to 30 min AND cap eval batches.
- HF cache defaults to container disk. Symlink `HF_HOME` to persistent volume immediately.
- Sweep experiments (multiple configs, one script, sequential) save GPU downtime. Add `try/except` so one crash doesn't kill remaining configs.
- The param-matched baseline ablation blocks ALL downstream decisions. Run it first.
- Making an op cheaper doesn't fix a quality gap. Speed ≠ quality.

## Repo Layout

- `STATE.md` — Current project state, what's running, dead ends
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — Architecture spec with verified citations
- `EXPERIMENT_LOG.md` — Every experiment and result
- `references.md` — Paper references library
- `experiment-runs/` — Archived exact scripts from each experiment
- `archive/` — Dead ends and superseded docs

## Hardware

- Local dev box — quick iteration for <15M params
- Cloud GPU(s) — connection details in a gitignored setup doc
- Bigger cloud — reserved for runs after code is proven

## Data

Code lives in this repo. Data and checkpoints live elsewhere.

- Large datasets and checkpoints are gitignored.
- A pointer file at the repo root documents where to find them.

## Research Direction

_(one paragraph, editable each cycle. Keep it current — stale direction statements mislead future agents.)_

## User Context

_(describe who you are and how you want to collaborate)_
