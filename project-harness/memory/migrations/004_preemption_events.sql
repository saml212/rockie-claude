-- Migration 004: preemption_events log.
--
-- Written by gpu.py's poll_once loop (and the autopilot monitor) when a
-- pod transitions from RUNNING to PREEMPTED/EXITED before its expected
-- runtime. Read by gpu.py's create-router as a cooldown filter:
-- (provider, gpu_type) pairs with a recent preemption are skipped or
-- pushed to the back of the rank for an exponential-backoff window
-- (10–60 min) so we don't immediately re-bid into the same hot market.
--
-- Lightweight log; no foreign keys to gpu_pods so we can record events
-- for pods we don't own (e.g. observed via reconcile, not via create).
