"""Seed workflow.db with generic harness-level rules.

Idempotent: skips rows whose (project, category, rule) already exists. Safe
to re-run on an existing DB.

This file seeds ONLY harness-level rules that apply to any project using
idastone. To seed project-specific rules (architecture gotchas, training
lessons, etc.), copy examples/seed_example_ml_research.py to a file in your
own repo and edit it. Do NOT add your project's rules here — this file is
the idastone default and should stay generic.

Project name is derived from the parent repo's directory name (the repo
that this .claude/ lives inside). Override with the PROJECT env var if you
want an explicit name (e.g. CI, detached worktree).
