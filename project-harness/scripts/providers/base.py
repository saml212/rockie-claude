"""providers/base.py — the Protocol every GPU provider adapter implements.

idastone is an autonomous-run harness: the agent provisions GPUs without a
human in the loop. Budget enforcement only works if every provider the
agent can spend on reports its costs through one uniform shape. This file
defines that shape.

Design rules every concrete adapter must follow:

  * **Pure API.** An adapter takes params and returns dataclasses; it does
    NOT write SQL, does NOT touch budget_usage, does NOT sys.exit. The
    harness layer (scripts/gpu.py, eventually) owns state and budget. This
    is what lets the router compose multiple providers cleanly and lets
    tests inject fakes.
  * **Honest flags.** supports_bid_auction / supports_pause_preserve /
    preemption_signal drive routing decisions and on-demand gating. Lying
    about them turns the router into a bug factory.
  * **billing_url.** Surfaced by `gpu.py dashboard` and `gpu.py cost` so
    humans can verify the harness's accounting against the provider's own
    UI in one click. Required.
  * **Raise from the hierarchy below.** The router catches AuthError /
    OutOfStock / BidRejected / NoCapacity to decide whether to hop, retry,
    or abort. Anything else escapes as a real error.
