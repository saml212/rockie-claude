"""Shared library for the Claude Code memory system.

Single SQLite DB at ~/.claude/memory/memory.db. Two logical tiers stored in
one table via the `project` column:
  project = <repo-name>  → repo-local memory
  project = NULL         → global (cross-repo) memory

Promotion from repo → global is empirical: when the same normalized rule
appears in 3+ distinct repos, the consolidator promotes it and marks the
per-repo copies as superseded_by the global row.

Dedup is automatic at insert time: normalized rule text (lowercase, collapse
whitespace, strip surrounding punctuation) matched against existing rows in
the same project. If found, hit_count++ instead of a new insert.
